    <h2>Brisbane Reimagined: The Artistic Journey of Nicole Nightmare</h2>
    <p id='body-text'>
        Nicole Nightmare is an emerging artist from Brisbane, 
        making waves with her distinctive creations. Her artwork 
        serves as a mirror to her experiences growing up in Queensland's 
        vibrant Sunshine State. Unmistakably Brisbane-centric, Nicole's 
        work delves into the exploration of form and function within the city's 
        evolving landscape.
